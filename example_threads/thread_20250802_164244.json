The intermittent failures occur when new tokens are generated during the 30-second key rotation window.\\n\\n**Immediate Action Plan:**\\n1. Alex - Implement token validation queue with retry logic (ETA: Tomorrow 2 PM)\\n2. John - Update key rotation schedule to off-peak hours (Tonight after 10 PM)\\n3. David - Scale auth-service instances for redundancy (Today 4 PM)\\n4. Maria - Prepare rollback scripts as safety net (Today EOD)\\n\\n**Client Communication:**\\nAman, can you draft an update for BigCorp? They'll likely ask about timeline. We're targeting full resolution by Wednesday evening.\\n\\n**External Consultant:**\\nMike Thompson from CyberSec Solutions will audit our auth architecture tomorrow at 2 PM. His assessment will help prevent future issues.\\n\\n**Budget Impact:**\\nExtra AWS instances + consultant fee ~$3K. I'll handle the approval with Lisa.\\n\\nLet's reconvene tomorrow at 9 AM for progress check. Thanks everyone for the quick response - the $45 lunch was well worth the brainstorming session!\\n\\nBest,\\nSarah\\n\\n--\\nSarah Johnson\\nSenior Engineering Lead\\nsarah.johnson@company.com\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-15T13:45:00Z\",\n    \"read\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"email_018\",\n    \"from\": \"sarah.johnson@company.com\",\n    \"subject\": \"Auth system fully operational - incident resolved\",\n    \"body\": \"Team,\\n\\nI'm pleased to announce that our authentication crisis has been officially resolved.

Jennifer was impressed with our transparency and rapid response. They're satisfied with our incident handling and technical remediation.\\n\\n**BUSINESS IMPACT:**\\n- Zero data breaches or security compromises\\n- Minimal user impact (estimated 0.3% session interruptions)\\n- Client confidence maintained through proactive communication\\n- Total cost: $3,156 (AWS scaling + security consultant)\\n\\n**NEXT STEPS:**\\n- Post-mortem meeting: Tomorrow 9 AM\\n- Documentation sprint: Friday afternoon\\n- 30-day follow-up security assessment scheduled\\n\\nThanks for the incredible teamwork.
